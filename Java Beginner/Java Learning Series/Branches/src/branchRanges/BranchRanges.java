		// We are going to study how to detect a range by using if/else_if/else branches.
		// Although we went over it in the previous video, let's really make sure that we understand
		// if, else if, and else.
		// So: "if" goes first. When detecting ranges, "else if" should come after if AND before "else".
		// "else" should always go last. Remember: else and last are both 4 letters.
		
		// Before we dive straight into coding, let's think about what we need to do.
		// But a quick note before we do that about relational operators. ('<', '>', "<=", ">=")

		// So now we have a rough idea on what to do. Let's make a simplified flow chart to guide us.
		// Awesome, so now we have a blueprint of what to do here.
		// Let's write some code to determine how risky our speed is!
